# AngularCLI Library With Assets

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.1.


## What this is
This is a basic Angular CLI project and library that illustrates how to export assets from
and library project for use in an application project.

The app project, `sandbox-for-assets` shows the setup for importing assets from the library,
`lib-with-assets`. 

Important files to pay attention to are:
 * angular.json
 * package.json
 * tsconfig.json
 
I have kept this repo as vanilla as I can with the Angular CLI setup.
So if you are familiar with a base CLI install of a project and library,
you will find that many of the files are still the autogenerated ones and not changed.

It may be helpful to look at the commit history of this repo since I made commits after the 
initial installs and then more commits with just the asset changes.

## More information
I've written a blog post that goes along with this repo.
It describes the basics of exporting assets from an Angular CLI library in 
either an AngularCLI monoropo setup, or as a published npm module.
